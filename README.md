# Visualization

The provided DotaLys data contains spatiotemporal data about (partial) matches from the game Defense of the Ancients 2 (DotA 2).
Our goal is to visualize the distribution of deaths in spacial and temporal distributions.
We want to provide a visualization that distinguishes these distributions per player level tier.

# Approach
## Must Have
* User-distinguishable tiers by use of categorical coloring and/or dropdown.
* User-controllable time differentiation (to see when in the match players die).
To expand: the user should be albe to define a margin of time to inspect, filtering the deaths
